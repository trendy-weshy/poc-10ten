# Proof of Concept - Rewrite of Batmobile

> This repository is a sample codebase of the expected structure and implementation of the rewrite

## How to install

Requirements are:

1. node >=8.+
2. typescript - `npm install -g typescript`
3. serverless - `npm install -g serverless`

## How to run

1. First install dependencies. Use the command: `$ yarn` or if don't have *yarn* use: `$ npm install`.
2. Then start serverless offline. Use the command: `$ sls offline start`

## Usage

- Using curl run make an API request to the route `http://localhost:3000/v1/valuation/` and `http://localhost:3000/valuation/`
- Also try, `http://localhost:3000/v2/valuation/`. It should error out *UnknownService*.

## Disclaimer

- This is not a rewrite of the batmobile project but just a skeleton of how the requested rewrite will look like.
